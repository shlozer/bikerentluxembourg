This project is a renting bike app.

You can choose your bike (if there are a least one :) on the station of you choice in the fabulous city of Luxembourg

Bikes availability come from the JCDecaux API and is refresh in live.

HOWEVER, you are not sending a real bike rent request. It's your web browser which just simulate the time left until it cancel your reservation.
